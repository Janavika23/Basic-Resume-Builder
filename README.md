# Basic-Resume-Builder
This repository contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript code for building a resume with basic details. 

# HTML usage
In HTML, I have used the basics like head, body, div class, input, label

# CSS Usage
I have kept CSS as optional because I wanted to focus on the basic steps. The user can also add few of the stylings for the content and beautify it. 

# Javascript usage
In Javascript, I mainly focused on function, and calling the function by giving the desired attributes.
